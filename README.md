# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is website based on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) where users can view, create and review campgrounds. It is built with Node.js and Express, using a Mongo Atlas database and deployed to the cloud using Heroku. It is large and significant application that is built together as part of long standing code-along (**over 12 hours!**) with the instructor throughout the course. The idea of the app is to give us a chance to incorporate all the concepts covered in the course, but it's also an opportunity to include more advanced features like image upload, cloud storage, and maps.
