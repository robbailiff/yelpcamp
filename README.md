# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is website based on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) where users can create and review campgrounds. It is massive application that is built together as part of long standing code-along (**over 12 hours!**) with the instructor throughout the course. The idea of the app is to give us a chance to incorporate all the concepts covered in the course, but it's also an opportunity to include more advanced features like image upload, cloud storage, and maps.

This is the final project for the **Web Developer Bootcamp 2020 by Colt Steele** on Udemy. This is an in-depth course with over 60 hours of content covering HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, Mongo DB and more.
